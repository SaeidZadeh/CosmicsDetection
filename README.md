## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive implementation of image segmentation using the powerful DeeplabV3+ model. The purpose of this code is to detect cosmics as masks in images obtained from X-ray data. The implementation includes various libraries, data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation steps to achieve accurate results.

## Libraries and Setup

The code begins by importing the libraries needed for the implementation. These include libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and others. Configurations are also set up to improve the quality of the images generated for visualization.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, the code preprocesses the data by identifying the image and mask files for the training and validation sets. The paths to the image and mask files are collected and stored in lists. The images and masks are then resized and converted to tensors with batches of size 6 using data generators.

## Model Definition: DeeplabV3+

\subsubsection{Model Definition: DeeplabV3+}
The DeeplabV3+ model is used for image segmentation. The code defines the model architecture, which includes a pre-trained ResNet50 as a backbone. The model uses convolutional blocks and dilated spatial pyramid pooling to capture contextual information from different scales of the image.

## Model Compilation and Training

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. Custom metrics such as specificity, precision, and recall are defined for evaluating the model. The code defines a scheduler for learning rate and early stop callbacks to improve training performance. The model is then trained for 100 epochs using the provided data.

## Model Evaluation

The code evaluates the trained model on the test set and computes various evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Pixel Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score. It also estimates the number of cosmics present in the test images using connected component analysis. The evaluation results are stored in different lists for analysis.

## Evaluation Metrics and Visualization

The code calculates the mean and standard deviation of the evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. Boxplots are used to visualize the distribution of each evaluation metric, providing information about the accuracy and precision of the model. The boxplots help to identify the differences in the performance of the model on different test images.

## Conclusion

With this implementation, the code provides a well-structured and complex solution for image segmentation with DeeplabV3+. It detects cosmics as masks in images obtained from X-ray data and evaluates the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics. The implementation shows how to effectively preprocess data, define and train a segmentation model, and evaluate its performance in a real-world application. The evaluation results and visualizations enable researchers and practitioners to analyze and understand the accuracy and precision of the model in detecting cosmics.
